Add fine post processing noise and jpeg artefacts to your image in comfyui. Good for that final polish stage.

Simple github publish of a python script created by u/flobblobblob on reddit based on the noise gui created by u/I_like_lips . 
I didnt do anything here, I didnt build this, I'm just making sure it's easier to install via github rather than creating these yourself

Should be able to install the custom node via the comfyui URL installer. 

Enjoy
